# Food Website Backend
To set up this project, follow these steps:

- you need to have both php & Mysql installed on your machine.
  - [download php](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.3.13-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip)
  - [download mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQLInstaller/mysql-installer-community-8.0.40.0.msi)
- steps to install both
  - #### php
    Extract the downloaded zip file into `C:\php\`
    (create `php` folder in **C drive** if it does not exist)
    Open This PC (run this in terminal)
    ```shell
    rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables
    ```
    find & double-click on`Path` under `System variables` section
    
    click `New` and paste this: `C:\php\php.exe` finally click **Ok**
  - #### MySql
    open `mysql-installer-community-8.0.40.0.msi` that downloaded in previous step *(**Stop** xampp mysql if it's already 
    started)*
    once the installer showed up choose `Full` and follow instructions to complete installation

### Booting up Application
- **Download this repository and extract it.**
- **open the project folder once it has been extracted**
- **Now we have to import `food-order.sql` into our database.**
  - open `MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE` by pressing `windows key` and typing `mysql work` (it must shows up)
  - click on **Local instance MYSQL80** and type the password that you set while installing MySQL
  - finally, let's import their database into our machine by clicking on `Server` at the top menu bar of the application
  - a list will be opened, now click `Data Import`
  - choose `Import from Self-Contained File` which is second radio button
  - then, click on `...` to chose `.sql` file
  - go to the project folder and select `food-order.sql`
  - after that, choose default schema(database), so tables will be created in
  - finally, go to `Import Progress` tab beneath **Data Import** title and click on **Start Import**
- **connect app to our database**
  - open `<project_folder>/components/connect.php`
  - change `$user_password` value to your database password
- **It's time to do our work and start the app to see how is their magic**
  - open project folder in terminal (right-click on an empty area and click `open in terminal`, *right-click two times if 
    that option does not exist*) 
  - run php server by executing this in terminal
    ```shell
    php -S localhost:88
    ```
    at the end, you can open the app in the browser from http://localhost:88/home.php
    the pattern is like this: `http://localhost:88/path/to/file_name.php`
  
I think that's all, feel free to ask for any confusing or something I forgot <br>
